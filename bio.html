            <p class="lead pr-5">I consider myself an artist who dabbles in all creative worlds. I always have a project going, often having too many projects and not enough
                 focus. My education was in studio art, with an emphasis in Sculpture. To me, sculpture has become the medium of endless possibilities. For the last 100 years or so 
                 artist have taken the fundamentals of form, space, mass, and material and really pushed the boundaries of what sculpture can be. It has since been (mostly) decided 
                 that sculpture can take the form of all other mediums. One can work in a traditional sense, chiseling marble figures or one can cut out a section of a roof to expose the clouds 
                 as a moving-painting. In my sculptural practice, I have worked with traditional materials, such as wood and metal, but also used found-objects, performance, video, 3D printing, 3D modeling,
                 and graphic design to create. I love learning new skills and employing those skills as tools for creativity!

            <h2 class="display-5 text-muted">Early Years of Culture, Technology, and Being Bored at Kinkos</h2>
            <p class="lead pr-5">I had many opportunities for creativity when I was young, my older siblings and cousins were all creative in different ways. Being
                one of the younger kids around, I was able to absorb everything that they were into. I had cousins who liked comics, my sister loved to draw and write poetry, 
                other cousins were into graffiti art, some were into rave culture and music. My mom worked at Kinkos when I was in elementary school, sometimes I would have to 
                hang out there for her entire shift. She would sit me at the computer lab, where I would play Prince of Persia, Mist, Tetris, or draw things in Photoshop. I got a lot of
                 Photoshop time in while I was young. I was also able to browse the internet for HOURS on end (this was in the mid-90s). America On-Line, or AOL, was all the rage at the time. It 
                 cost money by the minute at home, but at Kinkos...it was unlimited. I quickly grew a love for all things internet. With the internet I was able to explore 
                 everything that my older siblings and cousins were into. I would find pages dedicated to comics, graffiti, video games, and music. It was the most incredible thing for a young
                 spongy mind to encounter. I started to learn about web development at this time. I did not know that it was called web development, but I knew that I could make my own website
                 and post pictures of things that I created and write about things that I liked! My first website came in 6th grade, dedicated to my fishing club but styled like a rave-flyer (I had just 
                 seen the movie, Hackers). The site was hosted by Angelfire or Geocities (I can't remember). The internet was and still is a large part of what inspires my creativity.

            <h2 class="display-5 text-muted">My Web Development Story</h2>
            
            <p class="lead pr-5">The internet is so ubiqutous and intertwined in everyday life that now it is hard to imagine it as it once was. The website I created in 6th grade used maybe 
                5 tags. It probably took 5 minutes to load the 1 giant jpg file. It was clunky and not formatted at all! I remember looking at Nintendo's flawless, seamless website trying to copy and paste
                code onto my site, only to have it not work at all! This did lead me to more exploration. I can't remember specifically the next website I attempted, but there were many. I know that I stumbled upon
                 flash, frame tags, and applets. This lead to something a little cooler, but still very clunky. Fast forward to college (early 2000s), and I was able to program a very nice page with 1 embedded flash file using 
                 adobe dreamweaver. I thought this was the future...fully customizable layouts and nice animated menus and buttons. They took forever to load and required the user to download the plug-in. They also 
                 were prone to crashing constantly. CSS existed back then, but was not the norm. After college, I was able to hone my web development skills a little further and create a portfolio site using CSS. However, right around this time
                  many companies were developing sites that made it easy to make your own page (precursors to squarespace). Also, facebook had taken off while I was in college, so I would just share everything on my page there.
                  In my 20s, I felt like a had less and less time to dive into web-development. It had always been an interest, but never became my passion and so I would find myself taking long hiatuses from learning new skills.
                  This would cause the technology to get ahead of my skill level, forcing me to reteach myself everytime I had a new web-project. After all these years, I am finally ready to approach
                  the journey head-on, staying consistant and focused, determined to build up the foundation that was always lacking!
